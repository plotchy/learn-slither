"""
This is a basic slither detector template.

Some basic setup:

Make a `custom` folder to hold your detectors in the slither project, such as
- `<path/to/slither>/slither/detectors/custom/`
- add a `__init__.py` file to this folder
this is where you will place your detector files

Place this file in the `custom` folder, and rename it to your detector name.

Add the following line to `<path/to/slither>/slither/detectors/all_detectors.py`:
    from .custom.hello_world import HelloWorld

Run slither with your detector:
    slither . --detect hello_world
